        <p id="italics">During the class</p>
            <class id="text_box">
                <p><strong>Warm up</strong></p>
                <p>Although your instructor will run through some basic warmups with you, there is no reason not to warm yourself up before a class as well. Particularly if you carry an injury.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p><strong>Entering the Dojang</strong></p>
                <p>Students entering, in either Do Bohk/Gi or street clothes, should bow to the instructor on the floor as soon as they enter the Dojang. This will be done without exception. The student does not have to wait for the instructor to acknowledge the bow if the instructor is busy.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p><strong>Starting the class</strong></p>
                <p>Students will line up according to rank and seniority. The higher-ranking member will be on the right. The instructor will take a position in the front centre of the class. The highest-ranking member in the class will call the commands:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Class Cha Ryut (attention)</li>
                    <li>Sah Bum Nim E Kyung Yet (bow to Instructor)</li>
                </ol>
                <p> </p>
                <p><strong>During the class</strong></p>
                <p>Proper respect and discipline shall be maintained always and Tang Soo Do ritual should be followed in a uniform manner. When the chief instructor of the school or a high-ranking guest enters the dojang, the instructor on the floor or highest ranking member in the class should call the class to attention and have the class bow. After respect has been paid the class should return to training immediately.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>When a student must leave the class, he/she should first receive permission from the instructor.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Dismissing the class</strong></p>
                <p>As in the beginning of the class, students line up according to rank. The senior member gives the following commands:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>1. Class Cha Ryut (attention)</li>
                    <li>Sah Bum Nim E Kyung Yet (bow to Instructor)</li>
                    <li>Yu Dan/Gup Ja E Kyung Yet (bow to Senior Black Belt/Gup)</li>
                </ol>
